# twilio_voice_API
"Twilio's Voice API helps to make, receive, and monitor calls around the world."  -Twilio

This project is part of an on-going exploration into app development. The source code is provided by Twilio and made available to developers to fine tune it to meet our requirements. The goal for this project is to test functionality and better understand what the code does, why it does it, and assist my Product Team in integrating a similar feature to the company website.
